# Doxygen Integration

Assuming Doxygen documentation is already configured correctly,
call the `run_doxygen` method in the configuration file (`conf.py`)
located in the `docs` folder.
Then add the Doxygen output to the table of contents (`_toc.yml.in`)

This project has [Demo Doxygen Docs here](../demo/doxygen/html/index),
which was achieved using the [configuration here](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core/blob/develop/docs/conf.py)
and the [table of contents set here](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core/blob/develop/docs/sphinx/_toc.yml.in).

See [this PR for a simple example of adding a Doxygen code snippet](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core/pull/222).
