# ROCm Documentation Core Utilities

ROCm Docs Core is also distributed as a pip package available from PyPi as
[rocm-docs-core](https://pypi.org/project/rocm-docs-core/)

## Purpose

This repository is comprised of utilities, styling, scripts, and additional HTML content that is common to all ROCm projects' documentation. This greatly aids in maintaining the documentation, as any change to the appearance only needs to be modified in one location.

## Usage

### Setup

- Install this repository as a Python package using pip
  - From PyPi: `pip install rocm-docs-core`
  - From GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core.git`.

- Set `rocm_docs_theme` as the HTML theme
- Add `rocm_docs` as an extension
- Optionally, add `rocm_docs.doxygen` and `sphinxcontrib.doxylink` as extensions

For an example, see the [test conf.py](./tests/sites/doxygen/extension/conf.py)

### Legacy Setup
